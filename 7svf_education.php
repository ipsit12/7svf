                Education is an important tool which is very useful in everybody's life. Education is what differentiates us from other living beings on earth. It makes man the smartest creature on earth. It empowers humans and gets them ready to face challenges of life efficiently.

                Education can be categorized into three main types: formal, informal, and non-formal. Formal education broadly aligns with organized, institutionalized learning models (such as learning seen in schools), whilst informal education describes the everyday learning that people experience throughout their lives, and which can go easily unrecognized. Non-formal education is less clearly understood. This type of education happens outside of the formal schooling system, but in settings that aren't regularly visited, such as museums. It can be a middle ground between formal and informal education.

                Essentially, education socializes children into society by instilling cultural values and norms, equipping them with the skills necessary to become productive members of society. Education is important for many reasons, including:
